# Chapter 001 - Software Engineering and Space Missions / Space Exploration

🚀 **Announcement about "Software Engineering Is ..."** 🌌

I want to share that I am starting a new series of humor posts: **"Software Engineering Is ..."**.
It will be dedicated to making **technical parallels between software engineering and many different areas**.

The first chapter will be something very inspiring for me:
✨ **Software Engineering and Space Missions / Space Exploration** ✨

I believe there are many interesting similarities — from launch preparation and mission control to problem-solving far away from home. My goal is simple: to make these posts fun, a bit unusual, and to look at our daily work from a fresh angle.

If you like engineering ideas, space topics, or just enjoy thinking about technology in a different way, you are welcome to follow my posts. 🌍➡️🌙

Feel free to suggest ideas for next chapters, and I will try to craft the perspective.

Let’s enjoy this small adventure together. 🚀
