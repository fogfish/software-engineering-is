# "Software Engineering Is ..."

Series of humor posts: **"Software Engineering Is ..."**.

It is dedicated to making **technical parallels between software engineering and many different areas**.

If you like engineering ideas, space topics, or just enjoy thinking about technology in a different way, you are welcome to follow my posts on Social Media.

Feel free to suggest ideas for next chapters, and I will try to craft the perspective.
